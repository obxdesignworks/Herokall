Hello everyone! This is my first Github'd app. It's a really basic Sinatra/Heroku/Twilio app that can be easily modified for your own calling purposes. 

For the code to be functional, you'll need a Twilio account (sign up at http://twilio.com). 

For this code, I assume you enter your Twilio SID and Token credentials into your Heroku config file. You can use another hosting service, but you'll need to set the environmental values for the Twilio SID/Token appropriately.

Hope you enjoy the app!
Tim
